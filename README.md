# simmer.io status

Hello,

This is Rocco the founder of SIMMER.io. 

The simmer.io website is down. We've been hit with a third DDoS attack. 

My google cloud hosting bill has been run up to over $100,000. I need to shut down the service.

Here is my reddit post: https://www.reddit.com/r/googlecloud/comments/1jzoi8v/ddos_attack_facing_100000_bill/

This includes simmer.io and sharemygame.com


## Your games
I am currently trying to figure out a secure way for you to get your game files that won't make me broke.

My current priority is getting all the services locked up and shut down, first though to stop my personal financial bleeding.

I will try to put up a youtube video about how to self host unity games on Github when I am able to get you your game files securely. You can also use itch.io which is a great service.

## Paid Customers
If you're a paid customer of SIMMERconnect, I'll refund your latest bill.

I'll prioritize getting paid users their files first.

The billing was completely on Stripe and the hack did not affect any financial information.

## Me
I'm very sad that this is happening. I don't know how I'm going to pay the cloud hosting bill and I'm hoping that Google cloud will offer some leniency, as I did everything in my power to lock things down as fast as humanly possible.

Best,

-Rocco
